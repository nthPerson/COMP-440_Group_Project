2. **Category Preview** - Visual preview of item icon based on selected categories

---

## âœ… Feature 1: Enhanced Image Upload

### What Was Fixed/Added:

#### **Item.jsx Page (Item Details)**
- âœ… **ImageUpload component now works properly** - users can update their item images
- âœ… **Added file system browsing** - users can select images from their computer
- âœ… **Added dual upload methods**:
  - **URL Input**: Traditional URL entry (as before)
  - **File Upload**: Browse and select files from file system
- âœ… **Automatic image hosting** - files are uploaded to Imgur CDN automatically
- âœ… **Image previews** - shows preview of selected image before uploading
- âœ… **Error handling** - clear feedback for upload failures

#### **NewItemForm (Item Creation)**
- âœ… **Same dual upload system** for item creation
- âœ… **File browsing capability** during item creation
- âœ… **Preview functionality** for selected images

### How It Works:
1. **User clicks "ðŸ“· Update Image"** â†’ Form appears
2. **User chooses method**: URL input OR file upload
3. **If file upload**: 
   - User browses file system
   - Image preview shows immediately
   - File uploads to Imgur CDN automatically
   - Final URL is saved to database
4. **If URL input**: Traditional URL entry (as before)
5. **Reset option**: Returns to default category icon

## âœ… Feature 2: Category Preview on NewItemForm

### What Was Added:

#### **CategoryPreview Component**
- âœ… **Visual icon preview** of the item's default icon
- âœ… **Updates in real-time** as user selects categories  
- âœ… **Shows first category's icon** (since that determines the default)
- âœ… **Helpful explanatory text** about how category selection affects the icon
- âœ… **Multi-category feedback** when multiple categories are selected

#### **Smart Preview Logic**
- **No categories selected** â†’ Shows generic package icon + "Select a category to see its icon"
- **One category selected** â†’ Shows that category's icon + "Default icon for this item"  
- **Multiple categories** â†’ Shows first category's icon + "First of X categories" + explanation note

### Visual Design:
- Clean card-style preview box
- Icon + text side-by-side layout
- Informational note for multiple categories
- Matches overall form styling
